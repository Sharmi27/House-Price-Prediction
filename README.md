This project is a complete end-to-end machine learning project that aims to predict house prices based on various features such as total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households, median_income, median_house_value and ocean_proximity. The project uses the popular California Housing dataset from Kaggle. The project involves various steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The project uses the Python programming language and popular machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
